# Discord Chat Filter

A tool for bulk filtering Discord message history with regex patterns.

I don't really have plans to maintain this in the future, was just thrown together in one afternoon borrowing lots of code from [Maunz-Discord](https://github.com/Vauff/Maunz-Discord), and therefore may have some edge cases unaccounted for. However, I figured someone else may still find this useful, since I only made this because I couldn't find any existing tool.

## Usage

```
java -jar Discord-Chat-Filter.jar
```
The bot will auto-create a `config.json` file on first start, and prompt you to supply a token from an app created in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You will also be prompted to supply a list of channel/thread ID's that should be processed. Next, create a `regex.txt` file in the same location, with each line containing a regex pattern that all messages should be tested for.

The bot has two operation modes (adjustable in config). 

### Mode 1

The channels/threads will have their full message history processed, any messages that match a regex pattern will be saved to a JSON file for each channel. After a mode 1 run has finished, these files can be manually reviewed (if desired) to remove any false message positives.

### Mode 2

All messages stored in the JSON channel files generated by mode 1 will be deleted.
